This directory contains the code generated by PVS2C from the *.pvs files formalizing AES encryption/decryption
with a proof of the invertibility of AES.  

The PVS files are included for reference, but they would require the "strings" branch of the
development version of PVS from https://github.com/SRI-CSL/pvs as well as the
NASA PVSLib library from https://github.com/nasa/pvslib.

The .c and .h files generated from the PVS prelude theories and the ones in the directory.

The C files depend on the GMP library being available as well as standard libraries such as
stdio, stdlib, inttypes, stdbool, stdarg, string, fcntl, math, sys/mman, sys/stat.h, and sys/types.

To test the generated C code at a shell, do
cc -O3 -Wall -o Rijndael pvslib.c finite_sequences_c.c integer_bv_ops_c.c bv_c.c bit_c.c file_c.c bytestrings_c.c gen_strings_c.c strings_c.c ordinals_c.c ordstruct_adt_c.c integertypes_c.c exp2_c.c euclidean_division_c.c real_defs_c.c Rijndael_c.c bytevectors_c.c hex_c.c simplifications_c.c Rijndael_m.c -lgmp

The clang compiler version used was 
Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin19.6.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin

The compilation generates a number of warnings that can be safely ignored.  

Then run ./Rijndael

Each test generates five lines, all in Hex:
INPUT STRING
KEY
CIPHER STRING
Inverse CIPHER STRING
Expected CIPHER STRING
